Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests, feedback, and the assistant's responses.
This summary should be thorough in capturing key topics, important details, interaction patterns, and user preferences that would be essential for understanding the conversation's context and continuation.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - The assistant's approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, important concepts, and significant details
   - Specific information, examples, or resources mentioned
   - User feedback, preferences, and emotional responses
   - Learning progression and context switches
2. Double-check for accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail

2. Knowledge Requests: Identify specific knowledge, explanations, or information the user is seeking from the AI

3. User Feedback and Preferences: Document any feedback about the AI's responses, communication style preferences, or corrections requested by the user (e.g., "be less verbose," "provide more examples," "explain differently")

4. Key Topics and Concepts: List all important topics, concepts, and subject matter discussed

5. Information and Resources: Enumerate specific information, examples, resources, or references provided or discussed. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include important details where applicable

6. Problem Solving: Document problems addressed and any ongoing efforts to resolve issues

7. Conversation Dynamics: Note the user's communication style, level of expertise, emotional state (frustration, satisfaction, confusion), and any adjustments made to match their needs

8. User Frustration Points: Specifically identify and quote instances where the user expresses significant frustration, impatience, or dissatisfaction with the AI's responses or the conversation flow

9. Learning Progression: Track how the user's understanding evolves throughout the conversation and any knowledge building that occurs

10. Context Switches: Identify when the conversation shifts topics or focus areas, and note any repeated patterns or recurring themes

11. Clarifications and Corrections: Track instances where the user needed to clarify their request or correct the AI's understanding

12. User Goals and Success Metrics: Distinguish between immediate requests and broader objectives, noting what constitutes success for the user

13. Assumptions Made: Track assumptions the AI made about user needs, context, or expertise level

14. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks or follow-up items that have been explicitly requested

15. Current Focus: Describe in detail precisely what was being discussed or worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant

16. Optional Next Step: List the next step that would logically follow based on the most recent work or discussion. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests and the topic being addressed immediately before this summary request. If the last topic was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the user's request

17. If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what was being discussed and where the conversation left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in topic interpretation

18. User Journey & Task Completion: Analyze the user's workflow - did they complete their intended task? Where did they get stuck? How many exchanges were needed? What was their entry point and approach?

19. AI Performance Issues: Identify instances where the AI failed to understand, provided incorrect information, or hit capability limits. Note any hallucinations or clear mistakes.

20. User Behavior Patterns: Document the user's information-seeking strategies, trust indicators (verification, doubt), and usage intensity (quick question vs. deep exploration).

21. Product Experience Insights: Note any feature discoveries, expectation mismatches, or workaround behaviors the user developed to handle AI limitations.

22. Conversation Quality Indicators: Track satisfaction signals (thanks, success expressions), abandonment patterns, and any repetitive questioning that suggests the user wasn't getting what they needed.

- "conversations involving role-playing with fictional characters"

1. **Conversation Classification** (1-2 sentences):
   Start with: "This is a [TYPE] conversation involving/where/about..."

   - "User seeks step-by-step guidance for [topic]"
   - "AI provides explanatory responses with examples"
   - "Conversation follows problem-diagnosis-solution pattern"
   - "User tests AI boundaries with controversial requests"
   - "Collaborative creative writing with iterative refinement"

3. **Domain and Theme Tags** (3-5 tags):

   - Creative domains: "creative writing", "storytelling", "character development"
   - Educational domains: "science education", "language learning", "skill tutorials"
   - Interaction types: "troubleshooting", "advisory", "collaborative", "exploratory"

4. **User Behavior Patterns**:
   - "User demonstrates [expertise level] in [domain]"
   - "User exhibits [frustration/satisfaction/curiosity] about [aspect]"
   - "User's approach is [methodical/exploratory/direct/iterative]"

5. **AI Response Characteristics**:
   - "AI provides [detailed/concise/cautious] responses"
   - "AI [accepts/refuses/redirects] user requests about [topic]"
   - "AI adjusts communication style to match user's [expertise/tone/needs]"

6. **Key Content Elements** (brief):
   List the main topics/concepts discussed, but keep it concise and pattern-focused.
