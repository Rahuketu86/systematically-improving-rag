# PART01: Exploring the WildChat Dataset

An interactive Jupyter notebook that analyzes user conversations with AI assistants to understand patterns, topics, and user behavior.

## Overview

This notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of the WildChat-1M dataset - a collection of real conversations between users and ChatGPT models. Through data analysis, topic modeling, and visualization, we discover what users actually ask AI systems and how they interact with them.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Data Exploration Techniques**
   - Loading and analyzing large conversational datasets
   - Creating meaningful visualizations of user behavior
   - Understanding conversation patterns and distributions

2. **Topic Modeling with BERTopic**
   - Automatically discovering themes in user messages
   - Using state-of-the-art transformer models for semantic understanding
   - Visualizing topic distributions and relationships

3. **AI-Powered Analysis**
   - Using LLMs to interpret topic modeling results
   - Creating hierarchical taxonomies of user intents
   - Extracting actionable insights from complex data

## Key Components

### Data Analysis
- **Dataset Size**: 50,000 conversations sampled from WildChat-1M
- **Languages**: 68 different languages (focusing on English for topic modeling)
- **Models**: User interactions with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- **Metrics**: Conversation length, message length, language distribution

### Topic Discovery
- **Method**: BERTopic with sentence transformers
- **Results**: 200+ distinct topics automatically discovered
- **Success Rate**: ~73% of messages successfully categorized
- **Outliers**: ~27% representing unique or noisy requests

### Topic Categories Found
- **Academic & Technical**: Chemistry, medicine, engineering questions
- **Creative Writing**: Story generation, character development
- **Professional Support**: Writing assistance, analysis, research
- **Practical Advice**: Problem-solving, how-to questions
- **Specialized Domains**: Legal, financial, scientific queries

## Technical Stack

- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Topic Modeling**: BERTopic, sentence-transformers
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **AI Analysis**: instructor, OpenAI API
- **Dataset**: Hugging Face datasets library

## Running the Notebook

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn datasets bertopic instructor openai
   ```

2. Set up API keys:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook exploring_wildchat.ipynb
   ```

## Configuration

The notebook includes configurable parameters at the top:
- `DATASET_SIZE`: Number of samples to load
- `TOPIC_MODELING_SAMPLE_SIZE`: Messages to use for topic modeling
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: Sentence transformer model choice
- `ANALYSIS_MODEL`: LLM for topic interpretation

## Key Insights

1. **Diversity of Use Cases**: Users engage with AI for everything from academic research to creative writing
2. **Context Matters**: Many queries include detailed background information
3. **Long Tail Distribution**: Few very common topics, many specialized ones
4. **Query Complexity Varies**: From simple questions to multi-part requests

## Why This Matters for RAG

Understanding user behavior is crucial for building better RAG systems:
- **Retrieval Strategy**: Different topics need different search approaches
- **Knowledge Base Design**: Need diverse, high-quality sources
- **Response Generation**: Balance between creative and factual accuracy
- **User Experience**: Design interfaces based on actual usage patterns

## Next Steps

After exploring the data, proceed to:
- **PART02**: Load data into vector databases
- **PART03**: Generate synthetic queries for evaluation
- **PART04**: Implement summarization strategies

This exploration forms the foundation for systematically improving RAG applications by understanding real user needs and behavior patterns.
