# Looking Ahead: Cohort 4 Plans

For the next cohort, I'm building out a **single project** that serves as a through-line:

---

# The Through-Line Project


## Week 1-3: Evals and Synthetic Queries and Finetuning

1. **Search over wildchat-1m**
2. **Create synthetic queries** to do evals
3. **Test BM25 vs semantic search**
4. **Finetuning query/conversation pairs**
   - Using an LLM as a judge to find hard negatives

# The Through-Line Project

## Week 4-6: Segmentation and Tools

5. **Generating summaries** to cluster and explore chat histories
   - Searching summaries becomes another tool to explore the data
6. **Proposing a few more tools**
   - Filter for conversation lengths
   - Filter for Time, Region, etc.
   - Filter for specific topics
7. **Creating an MCP** to wire everything together

# Between Cohorts
