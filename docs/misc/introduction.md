# Introduction to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems with generative AI models. This hybrid approach helps to address limitations of large language models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant context from external knowledge sources.

## What is RAG?

RAG is a technique that:

1. **Retrieves** relevant information from a knowledge base in response to a query
1. **Augments** a prompt with this retrieved information
1. **Generates** a response using an LLM with the augmented context

This approach helps overcome several limitations of traditional LLMs:

- **Outdated knowledge**: LLMs can only access information they were trained on
- **Hallucinations**: LLMs sometimes generate incorrect information
- **Limited context window**: LLMs have constraints on how much text they can process at once
- **Lack of specific domain knowledge**: LLMs may not have deep expertise in specialized domains

## Why Improve RAG Systems?

While basic RAG implementations can be effective, there are numerous opportunities to enhance performance:

- **Better retrieval**: Improving how relevant information is found
- **Smarter augmentation**: Optimizing how retrieved information is incorporated
- **Enhanced generation**: Fine-tuning the response creation process
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Measuring and tracking system performance

This documentation serves as a guide to systematically improving each component of RAG systems, with practical implementation advice and real-world examples.

## Core Components

A RAG system typically consists of:

1. **Knowledge Base**: The corpus of documents or information sources
1. **Embedding Model**: Transforms text into vector representations
1. **Vector Database**: Stores and enables similarity search on embeddings
1. **Retriever**: Finds relevant information from the knowledge base
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Constructs effective prompts with retrieved information
1. **LLM**: Generates the final response

In the following sections, we'll explore each component in detail and provide strategies for optimization.
