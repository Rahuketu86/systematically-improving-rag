# Learning Goals: Developing AI Product Sense

## Why This Book Exists

When I started teaching RAG development, I noticed something important. Most courses teach you the technical parts – how to connect to an API, how to set up a vector database, or how to write a prompt. But they miss something critical: **how to think about your AI product as a whole system that gets better over time.**

This book exists to fill that gap. My goal isn't just to teach you technical skills, but to help you develop what I call "AI product sense" – the ability to think strategically about AI products, make smart decisions about what to improve, and create systems that get better with use.

## What You'll Take Away

By the end of this book, you'll be able to:

1. **Build improvement systems, not just features**

   - Design RAG applications that collect valuable feedback
   - Create measurement frameworks to track performance
   - Set up processes that turn user interactions into training data

1. **Make data-driven decisions**

   - Set up proper evaluation metrics before making changes
   - Generate synthetic data to test improvements
   - Analyze patterns in user behavior to identify opportunities

1. **Prioritize efforts for maximum impact**

   - Identify which improvements will deliver the most value
   - Understand which user segments benefit most from specific features
   - Develop roadmaps based on data rather than hunches

1. **Build specialized solutions for specific problems**

   - Design purpose-built retrievers for different content types
   - Create query routers that direct questions to the right tools
   - Implement feedback mechanisms tailored to different use cases

1. **Think beyond technical implementation**

   - Consider user experience in every design decision
   - Understand the business impact of your technical choices
   - Communicate effectively about AI capabilities and limitations

## What Makes This Different: The Product Sense Approach

This isn't just a technical manual – it's a guide to thinking about AI products in a more holistic way. While other resources might teach you how to implement a specific technique, I'm going to teach you how to:

- **Ask the right questions**: Instead of "How do I use the latest embedding model?", you'll learn to ask "What problem am I really trying to solve for my users?"

- **See the whole system**: You'll understand how each part of your RAG system affects the others, and how small changes can have big impacts.

- **Make strategic choices**: You'll learn when to use specialized solutions, when to collect more data, and when to focus on improving user experience.

- **Build with evolution in mind**: Everything you build will be designed to get better over time, not just work once and be forgotten.

## Who Benefits from This Approach

The AI product sense you'll develop applies across many roles:

- **Engineers** will learn to build systems that improve with use, not just meet initial requirements.

- **Product managers** will understand how to prioritize AI features based on user impact, not just technical interest.

- **Data scientists** will see how their models fit into broader systems and user experiences.

- **Founders and leaders** will develop a framework for thinking about AI investments and strategic decisions.

No matter your role, you'll finish this book with a clearer understanding of how to build AI products that deliver real value and improve over time.

## The True Goal: Creating Learning Systems

The deepest goal of this book isn't just to help you build better RAG applications. It's to change how you think about AI products altogether.

By the end, you'll see that the most valuable AI systems aren't the ones with the most advanced models or the fanciest features. They're the ones designed to learn and improve with every interaction – the ones that create a positive cycle where user engagement leads to better performance, which leads to more user engagement.

This mindset – this product sense – is what separates truly transformative AI implementations from the many disappointing ones we see in the market today. And it's what I'm most excited to share with you through this book.
