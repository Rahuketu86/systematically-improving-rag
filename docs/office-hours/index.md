# Office Hours

This section contains summaries and key insights from our weekly office hours sessions, where we discuss challenges, solutions, and best practices for RAG systems.

Office hours are now organized by chapter, matching the structure of the main workshop curriculum. Each chapter contains all relevant sessions from both Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 for that topic/week.

If you want to see all the questions and answers, you can find them in the [FAQ](faq.md) page.
