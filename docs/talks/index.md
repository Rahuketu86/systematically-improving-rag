This section contains talks and presentations from the Systematically Improving RAG Applications series, featuring insights from industry experts and practitioners.

## Featured Talks

### Core RAG Concepts

#### [RAG Anti-patterns in the Wild, and How to Fix Them](rag-antipatterns-skylar-payne.md)

We welcomed Skylar Payne to share their extensive experience identifying common RAG anti-patterns across different industries. This talk provides practical advice for improving AI systems through better data handling, retrieval, and evaluation practices, highlighting the most frequent mistakes teams make in RAG implementations and concrete strategies to avoid them.

#### [Agentic RAG](colin-rag-agents.md)

We hosted Colin Flaherty (previously a founding engineer at Augment and co-author of Meta's Cicero AI) for an eye-opening discussion on autonomous coding agents and retrieval systems. This session explores how agentic approaches are transforming traditional RAG systems, revealing surprising findings about when simple tools like grep outperform sophisticated embedding models, and how agent persistence can overcome retrieval limitations.

### Search and Retrieval

#### [Semantic Search Over the Web with Exa](semantic-search-exa-will-bryk.md)

We had an illuminating conversation with Will Bryk from Exa about how AI is fundamentally changing search requirements. Will shared the technical challenges of building a semantic search engine designed specifically for AI applications rather than human users, offering unique insights into the evolution of search technology and what the future holds for AI-powered search.

#### [Understanding Embedding Performance through Generative Evals](embedding-performance-generative-evals-kelly-hong.md)

Kelly Hong joined us for a deep dive into generative benchmarking - a novel approach to creating custom evaluation sets from your own data. This talk teaches you how to move beyond generic benchmarks to create evaluations that actually match your specific use case, dramatically improving your ability to assess and select embedding models.

### Document Processing and Ingestion

#### [Better RAG Through Better Data](reducto-docs-adit.md)

We then had a great talk by Adit Abraham (Co-founder & CEO of Reducto) called Better RAG Through Better Data, where he shared practical insights on document ingestion pipelines that work in production environments, not just in demos. This conversation covered parsing complex documents, handling tables and forms, optimizing data representation for language models, and addressing the long tail of edge cases that make production-ready AI systems difficult to build.

### Production Systems

#### [Online Evals and Production Monitoring](online-evals-production-monitoring-ben-sidhant.md)

Ben Hylak and Sidhant Bendre delivered a comprehensive session on AI monitoring and production testing. They shared their framework for identifying issues in AI systems before users notice them, including the Trellis framework they've developed for managing AI products at scale. This talk is essential for anyone moving from prototype to production.

### Innovative Approaches

#### [RAG Without APIs: When Function Calling Talks to Your Browser](rag-without-apis-browser-michael-struwig.md)

In this lightning lesson, Michael Struwig presented a novel approach to RAG systems that completely rethinks how we connect AI to sensitive data. By leveraging the browser as a data layer instead of traditional APIs, this technique enables secure, flexible AI-powered analysis tools that can access data without exposing it through conventional endpoints.

## About the Series

These talks are part of the "Systematically Improving RAG Applications" educational series, which focuses on practical approaches to building, monitoring, and improving RAG systems in production environments.

Each talk provides deep insights from industry experts who have built and scaled RAG systems in production. Topics range from fundamental concepts and common pitfalls to advanced techniques for document processing, evaluation, and production monitoring.
