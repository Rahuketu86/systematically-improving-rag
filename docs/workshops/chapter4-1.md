# Topic Modeling and Analysis: Finding Patterns in User Feedback

## The Problem: Too Much Feedback, Not Enough Insight

So you deployed your RAG system and added feedback collection. Great. Now you've got thousands of queries, ratings, and signals. Your manager asks "What should we improve next?" and you realize you have no idea.

This happened to me. We had tons of data but no systematic way to find patterns. Looking at individual bad ratings wasn't helping - we needed to see the bigger picture.

The solution? Topic modeling and clustering. Instead of reading through feedback one by one, you group similar queries and look for patterns. This lets you find the real problems worth fixing.

Here's the thing: not all improvements matter equally. Some query types affect 80% of your users. Others might be rare but critical for your biggest customers. You need to know the difference.

Think of it like product management - you segment users and focus on what matters most. Same with RAG queries. A small fix for a common query type beats a perfect solution for something nobody asks.

I'll show you how to:

- Segment queries into meaningful groups
- Find performance patterns that actually matter
- Build a roadmap based on data, not guesswork
- Know exactly where to spend your time
