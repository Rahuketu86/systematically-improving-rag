# Prioritization and Roadmapping: From Insights to Action


## Topics vs Capabilities: Two Ways to Slice Your Data

You need to understand the difference between topics and capabilities before you can prioritize anything. Most teams mix these up and end up wasting time.

**Topics** = What users ask about (account management, pricing, technical specs)

**Capabilities** = What they want the system to do (summarize, compare, explain step-by-step)

Most teams only look at topics. That's a mistake. You need both dimensions to understand what's actually broken.

Example from a healthcare company I worked with: They were categorizing everything by medical condition. Seemed logical, right? But when we added capability analysis, we found:
- Common conditions (diabetes, hypertension): Users mostly wanted comparisons between treatments
- Rare conditions: Users needed comprehensive summaries of all options

Same topic dimension, completely different capability needs. This changed everything about what we built next.

Here's what this looks like in practice:

"How do I reset my password?" → Topic: Account security, Capability: Step-by-step instructions

"Compare the Pro and Basic plans" → Topic: Pricing, Capability: Comparison

"Summarize the latest release notes" → Topic: Product updates, Capability: Summarization

See how the same capability (like comparison) can apply to different topics? And the same topic can need different capabilities? That's why you need both.
